# Real-Time-Face-and-Eye-Detection-Using-OpenCV
This project demonstrates real-time face and eye detection using Haar Cascades in OpenCV. It captures video input from a webcam, processes each frame to detect faces and eyes, and draws bounding boxes around them. The project utilizes pre-trained Haar Cascade models to identify facial features.
